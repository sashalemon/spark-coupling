# libcourier

Coupling of Spark and native programs with in-memory data transfer of non-nested row-oriented C-compatible data.

This repo provides multiple artifacts because there are two halves to the library, plus a code generator.

TODO: This should probably also hold some boilerplate for launching things on an HPC cluster, as the process is a bit involved. The requisite scripts exist, and should just need to be moved to this repo.
